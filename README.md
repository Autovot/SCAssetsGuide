## Description

Guide on how to get Star CItizen assets for your projects

At the moment the guide will only be in Spanish goto "DOCS" folder and open "ES" folder

I leave a guide in English that is in the spectrum of where I have based myself to make this - [link](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50172/thread/how-to-start-modding-existing-star-citizen-assets)

## TODO

Apart from a guide I want to make a powershell script with GUI to automate most of the process
